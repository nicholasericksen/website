# Learn by Asking, Teach by Asking
In a world where political correctness and peoples feelings take precedent over 
rational thought, where does that leave an inquisitive mind?
Let's use our imagination and a bit of Roman history.

## The Art of Oration
The original required learnings of any good Roman citizen was that of 
reading, writing, and oration.
You may be wondering where arithmetic fits into all this.
Well it wasn't invented yet, but that was eventually added as well and 
eventually replaced, much to our own downfall, the art of oration.

Oration if we ask Webster is "an elaborate discourse delivered in a formal and dignified manner".
This ability and value is one every citizen of a true democracy should cherish.
Let's save an analysis of republics for later (Plato wrote 'The Republic' and I highly recommend it for some light reading while on holiday).
Free speech is a fundamental right in America and many other places, but it seems that 
does not come without consequence these days.
We are far removed from the ideals of a civilization that values open thought justified through poignant delivery.
At best we have a few politicans showboating in an attempt to line there own pockets in some convoluted way.
Don't even get me started on Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus.
Some of these people should probably go back to there farm now too, lol. 

Simply, today the public forum is completely replaced by online quibbles behind a keyboard for the ordinary, average citizen.
And therefore this is one pillar of democracy which is crumbling. 
Go out into the town square and deliver a speech.
Use the internet to promote it.
Both can live in harmony but we must understand how to truly use the tools we have created for ourselves.

## Debating Amongst Ourselves
A public forum is one thing, but what about the personal groups of our daily lives?
It seems many conversations often become heated when the topics involved are intentionally bifracated.
No progress is ever made in a world full of political tropes repeated by the herd of sheep, each different only by the color of there fleece.
It was Socrates who is attributed to methods of teaching by asking questions.
This fundamental methodology is an approach which requires in it's purest form the acceptance of no bias.
You must not have an opinion at all, yet be formulating one constantly.
Asking questions is a fundamental part of learning.
How can someone be wrong in there opinion?
How can someone be right?

In order to not digress into Taoist thinking tonight, I leave you with this and will save that for another time.

Ask and be not afraid to learn, know your own self and never be afraid of change. Teach others this process, watch the world change (for the better).
