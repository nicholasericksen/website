# The World We Live In

It seems as the holiday season comes to an end every year and we look towards our 
never binding New Years resolutions, a time of reflection is inevitabley upon us.
It is a time to reflect back on what we have accomplished and what we wish to accomplish 
in the year ahead.

I don't often make personal goals but I do have a short list of things I would like to be
more engaged in next year. This includes becoming a certified HAM radio operator, learning
more about geographic systems and mapping, and getting out camping in the wilderness.
I am a bit of a hiker already but overnight stays are more elusive than they should be.

Beyond these personal goals I often reflect upon the world we live in. 
The current state. Both reality and politically.
These are certainly two distinct things.
More and more the people and there governments seem to be disconnected from one another.
Sure a populist movement on it's surface seems like it is parading the will of the people,
but most of the time it is merely a masquarade it seems.

The more I have travelled the world and had the pleasure of speaking with individuals, the more 
I believe we all want the same things regardless of where we come from.
Peace, stability, a home for our families and some food to eat.
A job which keeps us off of the street.
Is this so hard for an institution to understand?
Or are there other forces at play which keep us distracted from loving one another?

In these last few days my family has sat around the table laughing and eating.
A bit less laughing though these days it seems.
We have much to be grateful for but the milieu, as they say, is more solemn.

It doesn't feel quite the same like it used to.
For society crumbles like stale bread, a bit at a time until there is none left.
Then the birds eat the rest.

The meek shall inherit the Earth. Rest assured, we will all feast together one day.
