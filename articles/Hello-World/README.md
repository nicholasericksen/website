# Hello World
Born and raised in Upstate New York, I am a New Yorker at heart.
I had a lot of positive influences around me and a computer early on,
so I started programming at a young age using HTML inside Dreamweaver with Flash (ahh the good old days).
In highschool I took my first course in C++ and upon seeing that black terminal with green blinking cursor
and I was hooked.<br/><br/>

In the begining of my years at Manhattan College I started as a Computer Engineering student, but felt I could 
self study many of the topics in CS classes so I switched to Electrical Engineering as my major to focus on my 
passion for mathematics.  Throughout college I (sort of) joked E.E. was my religion. So much so that after four
years of it I decided to continue on for my Masters degree. <br/><br />

During my graduate studies I worked as a programmer returning to my original love, but now getting paid to do it!
My thesis was based in the intersection of computer imaging, polarization of light, and the environment.
Throughout my life I have always spent a lot of time outdoors in the woods, and applying my passion for technology with 
the environment was a dream come true. <br /><br />

So it was a lot of fun in those days but towards the end of my studies an opportunity popped up out of the blue to work
for a cyber security company implementing automation with a security focus for organizations.
The intital days of learning the ins and outs of system engineering, customer engagements, and business was an exciting adventure.
And still is to this day! <br /><br />

Thus I have remained for the better portion of the last decade working with some of the largest organizations in the world as a
Senior Solutions Architect helping to consult with them on how to best approach and implement Security Orchestation and Automation Response (SOAR)
workflows. <br/><br />

You never know what life may bring you so be sure to always follow the adventure! At least that has worked for me so far.
On this site you will find some of my favorite projects I have worked on and random thoughts as well.
It is a good excersise to summarize these things over time for me, and hopefully a bit enjoyable for you! <br/><br />
