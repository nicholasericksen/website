   A Tale of Two Github Accounts
  </h1>
  <p>
   Its always concerning when you have more than one Github account.
Why should a work and personal account really be separated?
Do you need to have anon accounts as well?
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the recent years, after university, I started soley using my 
work Github account. 
I thought this would create some amount of seperation.
Truth is is really just hurts.
We all do it for those green little squares at the end of the day anyway, right?
  </p>
  <p>
   I know the end result is really what matters and the game is rigged either way
but something about those green little squares makes me feel like I am making 
tangible progress in my life.
In a world where it is easy to take things for granted and you sometimes need
to remind yourself of the incremental things that you do each day to make 
progress. Progress with your family, with your self, job, community, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Programming is a big part of who I am.
Not my job.
Not my title.
But something fun and creative.
Something to scratch my brain at.
Something I can always win at in the end.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having multiple identites around Github makes me feel less whole.
When it is seperate, or I can't commit wholley to myself,
then I am missing a piece of me.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today I feel more myself than I have over the last few years.
Bringing it back full circle to my true Github account is one of the
last pieces of this introspective journey.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's funny how one can digress..
