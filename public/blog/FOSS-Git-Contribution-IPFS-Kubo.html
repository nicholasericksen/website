   Open Source Contribution - IPFS Kubo
  </h1>
  <p>
   IPFS Kubo is the Go implementation of IPFS and was the first one created.
For those who don't know IPFS is the "Inter Planatary File System" and is 
essentially a decentralized file storage system. It's cool, definitely check it out.
It has become more popular with the rise of NFTs.
Paired with FileCoin and it's is really something to look at if you are into decentralized applications.

  <h2>
   So what?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Well recently I have been building a little project which leverages IPFS and needed to interface with a local 
daemon in Go. (more on that at another time).
But if you are interested in getting started with IPFS locally the easiest way is to spin it up in a docker container
I found. You can find an example I published
   <a href="https://github.com/TheJellyLand/private-ipfs-example">
    here
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   While I was investigating the Go RPC client I noticed an issue...so I forked the IPFS/Kubo repo and made the change myself.
+1 for society at large. I have had a couple of contributions to open source repos in the past through work and other github accounts,
but this year I really want to focus on my original "nicholasericksen" github profile which has been a bit sad these last few years.
You can't always publish anon content..
  </p>
  <p>
   Well here is the fix:
   <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10267">
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   A minor change to the documentation for a broken link, but hey you have to start on these things somewhere. 
Every little bit helps. The maintainer thought so as well. They approved it for auto-merging and said "Thx".
Big win today. Big win.
