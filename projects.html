      <li><a href="assets/Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Masters Thesis</a></li>
      <p>
        "Polarization Enhanced Texture Analysis. With Applications to Precision Agriculture" is a thesis written to fulfill the requirements for my 
        Masters in Electrical Engineering from Manhattan College. This was a multi-year project taken on with Dr. Romeo Pascone to better understand the capabilities of 
        polarization based imaging techniques with texture feature extraction from plant samples for the purpose of species classification and 
        measurement of physiological properties such as water content.

      <li><a href="assets/ericksen_texture_polarization_vegetation_v2.pdf" target="_blank">Research Paper</a></li>
      <p>
        "A Texture and Polarization Based Imaging Technique for Determining the Relative Water Content of Vegetation" is a research paper which was crafted based on the research
        performed during the course of my Masters Thesis. This is a shortened summary of the results with a focus on Relative Water Content (RWC) measurements.
        Many of the techniques used and described are derived from the field of remote sensing. 
        The intersection of technology and environmental conservation is a passion of mine. [unpublished]

      <li><a href="https://github.com/nicholasericksen/vcp-soil-study" target="_blank">Van Cortlandt Park Soil Study</a></li>
      <p>
        Van Cortlandt Park is the third largest park in New York City, yet it remains vastly understudied.  This soil study was performed in conjunction with the Parks department
        and Lehman College.  The techniques used in this study were designed to determine the concentration of minerals amongst different geological sections of the park in order to 
        understand there relation to one another. Some of the data analysis work from the study which I conducted is summarized here.

      <li><a href="https://github.com/nicholasericksen/GHV-data" target="_blank">Science Barge Application</a></li>
      <p>
        The Science Barge is an facility for teaching the public about conservation and the natural environment located in Yonkers, New York.  It is run by Groundwork Hudson Valley and 
        many volunteers.  This project is displayed on touchscreen devices located on the barge to help educate the public through various materials such as videos, data, and studies.
        It was a volunteer effort showcasing the intersection of technology and environmental awareness.

      <li><a href="">VPN</a></li>
      <p>
        A virtual private network (VPN) is a way to route traffic from a computer through another IP address.  This is of course an overly simplistic definition but it highlights
        a key idea of VPNs which is to hide the location and details of the end user from prying eyes. This may be due to a desire to avoid targetted marketing for a normal user to the 
        extreme end of bypassing unjust censorship of information. This project was inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand">Streisand Project</a> that had
        a goal of deploying VPN services easier for end users. After many attempts it seemed quite flawed so I put together this easy to deploy wireguard VPN service in Digital Ocean.
